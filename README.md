Ergodox EZ Layout
=================

This is the layout I currently use on my Ergodox EZ keyboard. "Key" (ðŸ˜œ)
features include

- Home-row modifiers via dual-function keys
- Minimal use of thumb clusters to avoid finger spread
- Number block and mouse control on secondary layers
- Linux and macOS layers

[Compiled layout](layout.hex)
